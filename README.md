# stereo_class-_d-_amplifier
This project is a stereo Class-D audio amplifier built entirely from simple, widely available components â€” no specialized Class-D controller ICs. The design uses a TLC/NE555 timer, LM393 comparator, discrete BJT totem-pole drivers, and logic-level MOSFETs to implement a complete half-bridge switching amplifier with LC output filtering.
